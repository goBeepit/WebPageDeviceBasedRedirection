WebPageDeviceBasedRedirection
=============================

A simple class, designed to handle device detection and redirect to a URL. We built it to work out of the box with our http://goBeepit.com service. But you could very easily change it to work with any URL. To generate your own, free mobile page - visit our website http://goBeepit.com

The class also leaves a hook so users from devices you wish to redirect automatically, can browse your regular website, if they use the hook, which is a GET parameter.
